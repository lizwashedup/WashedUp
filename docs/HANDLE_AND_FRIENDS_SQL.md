# Handle + Friends Migration

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor (Lovable) before using the Your People feature.

The migration file is at: `supabase/migrations/20250226000000_handle_and_friends.sql`

If you use Supabase CLI migrations, run:
```bash
supabase db push
```

Otherwise, copy the contents of that file and run it in the SQL Editor.
